# Eventbuzz-App
The basic idea of our project is to create a platform that helps the faculty
members to interact with their students by sending important notices or the information that
they wish to convey to the students as well as lets the students convey event information
among themselves. The app will be having separate login for the faculty and the students. The
faculties can post notices to their respective batches and the students will be notified about
the information when they login using their respective ids. The faculties can also view the
events happening in the college using their respective id. One of the major utilities of the app
is that everyone will be aware of each and every event that is being conducted. Our app helps
students not only to post events but also view the details of the events that are going to be
held. Events include all the activities in the college, from regular CC classes to Ted talks,
Debates, notifications of committees like E-Cell, Dramatics etc.,. In a nutshell we can also think
of it as online notice board.
